Collecting property listing from a desired area under the price of 3000 dollars
Part 1 - Scrape the links, addresses, and prices of the rental properties using Beauifulsoup. 
Use our Zillow-Clone website (instead of Zillow.com).

Using Selenium to fill in the form created. Each listing have its price/address/link added to the form.
